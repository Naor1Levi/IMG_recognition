# IMG_recognition
OpenCV module that uses camera as an input to find specific img in a web camera stream.

My script uses RedMarlboro as the img but you can create your own IMG recognition by those simple steps:
1. Take a picture of an object you want to identify and replace it with the "marlboro.png" file.
2. search in the script the "marlboro.png" text and replace it with your file name.
* NOTICE 
for a good recognition matching rate the picture you shoot for the reconition program should be the same quality as your web camera
